# Experiment
In this experiment we generate a report for a simulated study based on a survey we created.
Survey can be found [here](https://cesarvillarrealg.typeform.com/to/XX9vwSu5)
The process for modelling responses can be found in [here](https://github.com/cesar-yoab/survey_modelling/tree/main/scripts)
If you do not wish to genereate the data yourself you can use the already generated data located
in this repository "survey_data.cvs".
