# Data generation methodology
We generated stratified samples with provinces used as stratums.
The assumption of the existence of a list of addresses that are used as the sampling frame, 
is made to simplfy the data generation process.
The design followed is Stratified Simple Random Sampling (SRSWOR).
The overall sample size is set to n = 10,000 with overall stratum population
assummed to be N = 38,005,238 the current population Canadian population estimate as of
Q3 2020 ((source)[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1710000901]).
